# Comprehensive Exam

Doctoral students will normally take the Comprehensive Exam (EPIB 701) within 12 to 24 months of entry into the PhD degree program. The Comprehensive Exam is held once a year in June.   

## Purpose 

The objective of the PhD comprehensive examination is to assess a student's ability to synthesize and apply knowledge of epidemiological and biostatistical principles. As is true for many doctoral level training programs, the overall rationale for a comprehensive exam is to ensure that students have the sufficient conceptual and methodological qualifications to pursue independent epidemiologic research.

## Content and Structure

The format of the exam is a computer-based typed response "in class" examination designed for a test-time of 6 hours total divided into two 3 hour blocks taking place over a single day, with a break for lunch. Exceptionally, the exam has also been given over two days in 3-hour blocks (i.e., 9:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. each day).

During the first session students will be asked a series of questions on two selected published articles (the articles are made available by e-mail to students at 9:00 a.m. the day before the in-class exam). Questions in this session test basic and advanced knowledge of epidemiologic concepts and principles, as well as of applied biostatistics.

The second session will be based on questions related to all aspects of study design, including statistical analysis. This will require students to integrate and apply their knowledge of several aspects of epidemiological and biostatistical principles.

## Evaluation

Results of the comprehensive exam will be transmitted to students within 3 weeks of the date of the exam. The exam is graded "Pass" or "Fail". Students with a "Fail" must repeat the exam the following year.

Students are required to pass *both* the first and second portions of the examination in order to pass the comprehensive examination. A passing grade on each portion of the examination is 65%. There is no provisional pass.

## Resources

Students are strongly encouraged to consult past exams (and more senior doctoral students) to understand better the types of questions that are likely to appear on the exam, and taking a full 'practice exam' is encouraged. Electronic copies of past exams are made available to students.
