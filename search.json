    "text": "2.1 Getting Started\nBy default, all doctoral students, even those that have previously discussed supervision with a faculty member, are initially advised by the designated PhD Program Director or Advisor. The advisor’s role is to provide early guidance on your academic program and career planning, to mentor you, and to serve as your advocate when necessary. Generally speaking, once a supervisor has been approved, the supervisor takes on the primary mentorship role.\nOf course, this does not exclude the possibility of a student-supervisor match at admission, nor the possibility of the academic Program Director or Advisor becoming a student’s supervisor.",

    "text": "2.2 Thesis Supervisor\nDoctoral students are expected to identify a supervisor (or co-supervisors) by no later than 15 February of their first year of study, but identifying a supervisor earlier is encouraged, as solid supervision is important for planning and making progress.\nIf you currently don’t have a supervisor, take the time to contact professors within the various areas of faculty research that interest you. Faculty research interests are broadly categorized on the departmental website. It is also worthwhile networking and discussing potential supervisors with your peers and more senior doctoral students. If you wish to be supervised by an Associate Member of the department it may be necessary to have a Full Member of the faculty as a co-supervisor. Contact the Student Services Office or the Program Director/Advisor for assistance.\nCo-supervision is possible and not uncommon. However, one member must be listed as the primary supervisor and must hold supervisory privileges according to EBOH guidelines. Co-supervisors that are not the primary supervisor do not have to be based in EBOH or at McGill.\nAlthough uncommon, note that it is certainly possible to change thesis supervisors at any point during your training. Generally, if you plan to change supervisors, it is advantageous to do so earlier rather than later in your training. Changing supervisors has consequences for funding and possibly your thesis topic and timeline, and the decision should be carefully considered. Before you make a decision to change, talk to the PhD program administrators.",

Committee members must hold a faculty or scientist appointment at a university or research institution, though there is flexibility to include members at non-research institutions if needed. The committee should be struck at an early stage of thesis research and certainly no later than the end of the semester in which the topic has been defined.\nMeetings with the entire thesis supervisory committee should be held as frequently as is necessary to ensure efficient progress of the thesis research, but at a minimum once per semester.",

They are NOT substitutes for existing courses but are, rather, ways for students in the programs to enrich their education in an organized way on topics not otherwise covered or not covered sufficiently (in depth or breadth) in existing courses.\nStudents enrolled in the department may take Directed Reading courses for credit towards a degree under the rubric of the Special Topics offerings. These courses may be for 1, 2, or 3 credits. Directed Reading courses should conform to the usual semester format unless the specific circumstances of the course require flexibility. However, students are expected to complete such a course within no more than any six month period. Students will be expected to submit for approval in advance material that provides the objectives and methods to be used for the directed reading work.\nThere is considerable flexibility in what constitutes a directed reading course, but certain requirements must be met before work can begin, including:\n\nStudents must themselves propose a supervising faculty member with whom to work.\nWith the faculty supervisor, students must prepare an adequate project proposal commensurate with the number of credits sought that includes:\n\n\nThe rationale for doing this work as a Directed Reading course and for the number of credits sought.

Students who have been admitted through their home department or faculty may apply for admission to the option. The option is coordinated by the CPD, in partnership with participating academic units.\nThus, in addition to the rigorous training provided in the Department of EBOH, graduate students who choose this option become Centre on Population Dynamics (CPD) student trainees. This affiliation notably offers opportunities for interdisciplinary research and supervision. The option also provides a forum whereby graduate students bring their disciplinary perspectives together and enrich each other’s learning through structured courses, a weekly seminar series, and informal discussions and networking.\nWith interdisciplinary research being increasingly important to understanding complex social and biological processes, CPD student trainees benefit from both a strong disciplinary foundation from their departmental affiliations, as well as from the sharing of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries through CPD activities.\nRequired Courses (22 credits)\nOption-specific courses are italicized\n\nEPIB 701 PhD Comprehensive Examination\nEPIB 702 PhD Proposal\nEPIB 703 Principles of Study Design (2 Credits)\nEPIB 704 Doctoral Level Epidemiologic Methods 1 (4 Credits)\nEPIB 705 Doctoral Level Epidemiologic Methods 2 (4 Credits)\nEPIB 706 Doctoral Seminar in Epidemiology (3 Credits)\nEPIB 707 Research Design in the Health Sciences (3 Credits)\nSOCI 545 Sociology of Population (3 Credits)\nSOCI 626 Demographic Methods (3 Credits)\n\nComplementary Courses (9 credits)\n9 credits of coursework, at the 500 level or higher, with a minimum of 3 credits in Biostatistics, 3 credits in Epidemiology, and 3 credits from courses approved for the Population Dynamics Option from the list below:\n\nECON 622 Public Finance (3 Credits)\nECON 634 Economic Development 3 (3 Credits)\nECON 641 Labour Economics (3 Credits)\nECON 734 Economic Development 4 (3 Credits)\nECON 741 Advanced Labour Economics (3 Credits)\nECON 742 Empirical Microeconomics (3 Credits)\nECON 744 Health Economics (3 Credits)\nEPIB 648 Methods in Social Epidemiology (3 Credits)\nEPIB 681 Global Health: Epidemiological Research (3 Credits)\nPPHS 525 Health Care Systems in Comparative Perspective (3 Credits)\nPPHS 528 Economic Eval of Hlth Programs (3 Credits)\nPPHS 529 Global Env Hlth&Burden/Disease (3 Credits)\nPPHS 615 Intro:Infectious Disease Epid (3 Credits)\nSOCI 502 Sociology of Fertility (3 Credits)\nSOCI 512 Ethnicity & Public Policy (3 Credits)\nSOCI 513 Soc Aspects HIV/AIDS in Africa (3 Credits)\nSOCI 520 Migration and Immigrant Groups (3 Credits)\nSOCI 535 Sociology of the Family (3 Credits)\nSOCI 588 Biosociology/Biodemography (3 Credits)\n\nCourses must be chosen in consultation with the student’s supervisor and/or the degree program’s director or adviser.\nPlease contact the Population Dynamics Option Advisor Amelie Quesnel-Valee for any questions regarding this option.",

Upon successful completion of this program, graduates are awarded a MDCM (Medicinae Doctorem et Chirurgiae Magistrum/Doctor of Medicine and Master of Surgery) degree and a PhD degree. Students in this program can complete their PhD studies in Epidemiology in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health.\nThe structure of this eight-year program is shown in the Figure below. From September of Year 1 to December of Year 2, students complete the basic and clinical sciences portions of the medical curriculum. During the Summer of Year 1, students will have 2 months to prepare for their training in epidemiology and conduct initial thesis research; this includes working with their supervisor(s) to develop preliminary thesis objectives, conduct initial thesis research (e.g., literature review), develop their data analytic skills, and start the progress of acquiring data, if applicable. All course requirements and milestones for the PhD in Epidemiology, shown in the Figure, must be completed within the four years between the Winter of Year 2 and Fall of Year 6 of the MDCM-PhD program, including thesis submission. Students then complete the requirements of the MDCM degree between the Winter semester of Year 6 and the end of Year 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nMD-PhD Timeline\n\n\n\n\nPlease contact the MDCM-PhD contact person Kris Filion for any questions regarding this track.",

The committee is designed to ensure a majority of members have not been closely involved with the thesis. “Closely involved” means serving on the student’s supervisory committee or having meaningful input into the body of work contained in the thesis.\n\nINTERNAL EXAMINER – submit two names  Usually chosen from members of the Department with expertise in the subject area of the thesis. The supervisor must contact both proposed internal examiners and secure from them a commitment (by email) that they are willing to serve in this capacity. The internal examiner must not be in conflict of interest according to McGill’s policy (see University conflict of interest regulations).\nEXTERNAL EXAMINER – submit four names in a ranked order  The external examiner must hold a PhD degree, or equivalent, and should be from outside McGill. The proposed external examiners should have demonstrated epidemiologic and/or biostatistical expertise, as well as expertise in the substantive area of the thesis. Please clearly indicate their qualifications and your main reasons for choosing them. The PhD Program administrators will validate the appropriateness of the proposed choices. In order to minimize any real or perceived conflicts of interest, the Department will contact the external examiner once approved to secure his/her commitment to evaluate the thesis. The student or supervisor should NOT contact any of the proposed external examiners.   External examiners must be perceived to be able to examine the student and the thesis at arm’s length, free of conflict of interest from any source. The test of whether or not a conflict of interest might exist is whether a reasonable outside person could consider that a situation could give rise to an apprehension of bias. The candidate’s unit must take reasonable steps to avoid recommending an examiner whose relationship with the candidate, the supervisor, or their research could be seen as jeopardizing an impartial judgment on the thesis. Any individual asked to examine a thesis must declare possible sources of conflict. The following checklist, while not exhaustive, itemizes situations that could represent conflict of interest, and thus need to be declared and generally avoided. It is the responsibility of the unit (student’s supervisor, chair or designate) to complete this checklist in consultation with the nominated examiner and provide it to the Thesis Office along with the Nomination of Examiners form.   An answer of YES to any question below would normally exclude this individual as an examiner. Address any queries to the Thesis Office:\n\n\nHave you co-authored or otherwise carried out research in collaboration with the student or the supervisor (within the last five years)?\nDo you knowingly have a financial interest in an entity that could benefit from the thesis research?\nHave you previously read the thesis, or parts of it, or evaluated the student’s thesis research (e.g., as an advisor, as a supervisory committee member, evaluator for progress tracking)?\nHave you previously examined or been examined by the student’s supervisor (within the last five years), e.g., the former student or former supervisor of the student’s supervisor?\nDo you have a former or pending affiliation with the student’s academic unit* (within the last five years); e.g., graduated from the same academic program or been offered an academic appointment in the unit?\nHave you held an academic appointment at McGill within the last five years?\nHave you engaged in (or intend to engage in) discussions/negotiations with student or supervisor relating to future employment or supervision?\nDo you have a personal or financial relationship to the student or the supervisor?\nRelationships that might appear to have a conflict of interest include:\n\nA past or present spouse or partner\nA close family member\nA past or present business partner\n\nHave you engaged in other activities that could be interpreted as conflict of interest? (please specify)\n\n\nINTERNAL MEMBER – submit two names  The internal member is a McGill faculty, or affiliated, member who may be associated with the student’s unit. You do not need to contact these individuals.\nEXTERNAL MEMBER – submit two names  The external member must not be from the unit and may be from outside McGill. The external member is distinct from the external examiner and does not submit a written report. You do not need to contact these individuals.",

Copies of any certificates of compliance must be retained by the supervisor and student in accordance with McGill’s policies on research ethics. Supervisors indicate on the Nomination of Examiners and Thesis Submission Form that the thesis research has complied with all ethical standards. See the Ethics and Compliance webpage for further information about certification and training requirements.\nEven if your supervisor has already obtained IRB approval for the larger research study of which your thesis work forms just a part, the departments insists (partly since you defend the thesis as your work, partly for training purposes) that you obtain IRB approval of the specific work you are doing, and include this specific approval (in addition to those for the broader project) in your own thesis.\nThe definition of “research involving human subjects” is broad. See Student Guide To Ethics Review For Research Involving Human Subjects. This document also describes research involving human subjects which does not require ethics review. If still in doubt, additional advice can be obtained from the Program Advisor or Director.\nApplications for ethics approval should be directed to the Faculty of Medicine Research Ethics Board (commonly referred to as the Institutional Review Board or IRB) or to one of the following Affiliated Hospital Research Ethics Boards: the McGill University Health Centre, the Douglas Hospital, the SMBD Jewish General Hospital or the St. Mary’s Hospital Centre.\nIn addition, you must complete the on-line interactive tutorial on research ethics released by the Interagency Advisory Panel on Research Ethics (PRE), a multidisciplinary body mandated by the three granting agencies to further develop the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS).This tutorial is a voluntary independent learning tool covering the first five chapters of the TCPS.
